title: About
---

My name is *Mohamed Mouine*, most commonly called **Med**. I am a software engineer and Devops specialist. I graduated from Laval university Qu√©bec City, QC, Canada in 2020.

Always thriving to learn new technologies and beating new challenges, I would love to discuss with you job/freelance opportunities or just any topic devops/software related.

I have made my proofs being a competitive programmer. I participated in most competitions and tech events I could attend and won on some occasions. You can find some of my records on the [resume](/resume) section of the site.

I am fluent in most popular technologies but I don't mind learning new things and getting out of my comfort zone.

I am a highly opinionated developer and I would be glad to debate you about architectural patterns, programming paradigms and system orchestration.

Feel free to reach out to me on any occasion in the [contact](/contact) section of the site.
